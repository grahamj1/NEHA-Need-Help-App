# NEHA-Need Help App

## Problem Statement
The end users for this Android app are pregnant women, persons with disabilities, senior citizens and persons with special needs. When they go to a new place where they don’t have friends or family, it’s difficult for them to ask for help when in need. The app will contain 3 sections:
- First screen is for user registration (person who will need help)
- Second screen is volunteer registration (person who wants to offer help)
- Third screen is help screen.
When user requests help, the nearest volunteer is informed (similar to Ola/Uber vehicles). If volunteer declines to offer help, request will go to the next nearest volunteer.

## Functionalities
- Real time login and signup, i.e., As soon as an user or a volunteer logins into the application, the information gets stored onto the firebase.
- Cloud Storage is built for the application to store and serve user-generated content.
- Volunteers gets the notification for help immediately after the user requests for help.
- Notification is sent to the volunteers based on the nearest person who has signed onto the application. This is done by obtaining the coordinates(latitude, longitude).
